# PhonPlotter
PhonPlotter (PP) is a methodology designed to facilitate acoustic phonetic experiments for those with minimal training in data science and computer programming. This, it is hoped, will encourage and inspire students, especially students at the undergraduate or MA level, to undertake preliminary acoustic phonetic investigations, gain experience in designing and implementing such experiments, and ultimately serve as a springboard into more in-depth analysis.
